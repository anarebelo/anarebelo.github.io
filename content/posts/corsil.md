# [A Portuguese Sign Language and Expressiveness Recognition Database](https://github.com/pmmf/CorSiL)

The CorSiL database was created within the framework of a research
project at INESC TEC, FEUP, Porto, Portugal, which aimed to develop
both a video-based automatic SLR system and a expressiveness analysis
method of the human body during the interaction between a pair of subjects. In this manner the CorSiL database has two major components (or
subsets) each one with a specific purpose:
1. [signLangDB]: a Portuguese Sign Language video dataset.
2. [corpLangDB]: a duo-interaction video dataset between Deaf and/or
hearing people.

For more information please read the following paper ![recpad2016](https://anarebelo.github.io/data/CorSiL_paper.pdf)

The team involved were: [Pedro Ferreira](https://github.com/pmmf/), [Eduardo Pereira](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eduardomarquespereira/), Ana Rio and I.
