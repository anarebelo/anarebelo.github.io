In collaboration with the [Imprensa Nacional-Casa da Moeda (INCM)](https://www.incm.pt/portal/index.jsp), our work obtained [MINEX III certification - Minutiae Interoperability Exchange](https://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/image-group/minutiae-interoperability-exchange-minex-iii) - by the [National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)](https://www.nist.gov) of the United States (US) Department of Commerce. This certification is a test used to establish that template generation and correspondence algorithms comply with the US government's Personal Identity Verification (PIV) program and aims to assess the quality and robustness of biometric recognition algorithms.

The submitted algorithm was for generating templates and the results can be consulted [online](https://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/image-group/minex-iii-compliant-submissions). Future work should focus on improving the template matching algorithm to also be able to certify this component.

The team involved were: [Eduardo Castro](http://vcmi.inesctec.pt/members/eduardo-castro), [Ricardo Ara√∫jo](http://vcmi.inesctec.pt/members/ricardo-ara%C3%BAjo), [Jaime S. Cardoso](http://vcmi.inesctec.pt/members/jaime-cardoso) and I.
