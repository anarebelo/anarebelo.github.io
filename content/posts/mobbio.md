# The MobBIO Multimodal Database

The MobBIO Multimodal Database comprises the
biometric data from 105 volunteers. Each individual
provided samples of face, iris and voice. The nationalities of the volunteers were mainly portuguese but
also participated volunteers from U.K., Romania and
Iran. The average of ages was approximately 34, being the minimum age 18 and the maximum age 69.
The gender distribution was 29% females and 71%
males

Portable Handheld Device.](https://anarebelo.github.io/data/2014ASequeiraVISAPP.pdf)

This database was used in [1st Biometric Recognition with Portable Devices Competition](https://paginas.fe.up.pt/~mobbio2013/) included in [ICIAR 2013 conference](http://www.aimiconf.org).

The team involved were: [Ana F. Sequeira](https://sites.google.com/site/afilipasequeira/), [Hélder Oliveira](http://vcmi.inesctec.pt/members/helder-oliveira), João Monteiro and I.
