# [Guest Editors of Special Issue on Human Activity Recognition](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors/special_issues/human_activity)

This special Issue aims to bring novel solutions to human activity recognition (HAR) through explainable techniques applied to deep learning models in order not only to classify the action scene, but also to give context understanding. We believe the introduction of transparency and explainability will increase the trust and accountability of a HAR system.
