# [Signer-Independent Portuguese Sign Language (SI-PSL) database](https://github.com/pmmf/SI-PSL)

The SI-PSL database was specially created for signer-independent evaluation purposes. It contains 31 isolated signs, representing the alphabet and the cardinal numbers 0 to 9 of the Portuguese sign language. All the signs were performed three times by a total of 11 native signers, in a free and natural signing environment, without any clothing restriction but with a slightly-controlled uniform background (see Figure below). Therefore, it clearly depicts the large inter-signer variability that exists in the manual signing process of sign languages. The proposed SI-PSL is made publicly available for benchmark purposes, in order to foster the signer-independent SLR research.

The team involved were: [Pedro Ferreira](https://github.com/pmmf/), [Diogo Pernes](http://vcmi.inesctec.pt/members/diogo-pernes) and I.
