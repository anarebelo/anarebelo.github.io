## Co-Founding and Coordinating
### Summer School
[VISion Understanding and Machine intelligence Summer School](http://visum.inesctec.pt) is a non-profit summer school that aims to gather Ph.D. candidates, Post-Doctoral scholars and researchers from academia and industry with research interests in computer vision and machine intelligence.

Through the creation of a specialized multicultural environment, it is intended to promote and increase the knowledge of all participants on the state of the art of these topics, provided by internationally renowned experts in data science field.

### Master's Degree in Data Science
Assistant Professor at the Department of Science and Technology at [Universidade Portucalense](https://www.upt.pt/) where I co-founded the [Master's Degree in Data Science](https://www.upt.pt/curso.php?e=940).
