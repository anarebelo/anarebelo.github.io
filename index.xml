      <description>In collaboration with the Imprensa Nacional-Casa da Moeda (INCM), our work obtained MINEX III certification - Minutiae Interoperability Exchange - by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) of the United States (US) Department of Commerce. This certification is a test used to establish that template generation and correspondence algorithms comply with the US government&amp;rsquo;s Personal Identity Verification (PIV) program and aims to assess the quality and robustness of biometric recognition algorithms.</description>
